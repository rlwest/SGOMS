# CCM Suite Environment Tutorial 3
#
# The purpose of this tutorial is to expand the previous one
#  so that we are measuring something specific about the
#  agent's performance.  In this case, we want to measure
#  the proportion of time they press 'A' in the first 100
#  trials, and the proportion of time they press 'A' in the
#  second 100 trials.  We call these Pmax1 and Pmax2, to be
#  consistent with (Erev and Barron, 2005).

                                         # instead of 100 because Python,
                                         # like most programming languagues,
